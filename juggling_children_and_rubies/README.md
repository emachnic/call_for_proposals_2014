# Juggling Children...and Rubies

"DAD! I'm hungry."

"DAD! Can you tie my shoes?"

"HONEY! The baby needs a diaper change."

How do you balance all the distractions with raising children and still be able
to deliver at your job? As Ruby developers, it's something that many of us can
relate to but few really talk openly about. I work full-time at Engine Yard,
create videos for Code TV, and also maintain RailsInstaller. All of that needs
to balance nicely with my family and this talk will explore some of the problems
I've faced and how I address them.

## Evan Machnic

I've been working with Ruby since 2008 and working at Engine Yard since 2011.
In my free time, I love stand-up paddle boarding, rock climbing and hanging out
at the beach with my family.
