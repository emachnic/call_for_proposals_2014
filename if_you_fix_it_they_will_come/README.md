# If You Fix It, They Will Come

Working in the Support organization at Engine Yard, I sometimes run into
platform issues when helping customers. Sometimes, the problem is big enough
that I need to create an internal ticket but many times, it's easier to
just fix the issue.

At Engine Yard, we're fortunate enough that if someone wants to work on the
platform, they are free to do so; just make sure everything is tested and
submit a GitHub Pull Request. Letting anyone in the company work on the
product makes employees and customers happier. This talk will encourage
business owners to give their employees more control and inspire employees
to put more into the products of their companies.

I've been working with Ruby since 2008 and working at Engine Yard since 2011. In my free time, I love stand-up paddle boarding, rock climbing and hanging out at the beach with my family..
