# A Messy Kitchen Is Not A Happy Kitchen

The Infrastructure as Code movement has been great in a lot of ways. It has
brought the idea of managing our servers in much the same fashion as we do
our applications. Unfortunately, our repositories tend to grow with the size
of the infrastructure and the amount of new components that need to be added.

We have to make sure to periodically clean our "kitchen" so that we continue
to be confident in making changes to the code base. This talk will focus on
some of the issues that I've seen when working with a large Chef repository
that powers the Engine Yard platform, specifically with trying to add new
features without breaking old ones.

I've been working with Ruby since 2008 and working at Engine Yard since 2011.
In my free time, I love stand-up paddle boarding, rock climbing and hanging out
at the beach with my family.
